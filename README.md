# Infrastructure Automation Continuous Integration Lab

## Introduction: 

In this lab, you will learn to use two industry-standard pipeline tools, GitHub and Jenkins, to build a simple CI/CD pipeline.  

## Objective

For this lab, you will gain hands-on experience using Jenkins for continuous integration and managing your Jenkins configuration
as code.  You will write pipeline jobs using the Groovy DSL and create those jobs in a "dockerized" Jenkins managed by a DSL seed job.

## Getting Started:

1. Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account. When adding a collaborator, be sure to add the instructor ("CSCC-Instructor").

## Understanding the Starter Code
This repository contains all you need to have a fully dockerized Jenkins that supports a DSL seed job and 
configurable plugins.  Note that you shouldn't have to change either the seed job provided or the plugins that are 
provided.  However, it's helpful to walk through what is provided, to better understand what you need to do.

#### Building a Custom Jenkins Image
Note:  You should build this image freshly even though we built a similar image in the previous Jenkins lab.  This image will have a seed job to make configuring your job easier
You are provided with a [build-jenkins-image.sh](build-jenkins-image.sh) script that will build the `edu.cscc.special-topics/jenkins:latest` Jenkins image.  You can look under [docker/](docker/) to see how the image is built:
1. There is, of course, a [Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile). Note that it uses jenkins/jenkins:latest-jdk11 as its base image. 
1. The `Dockerfile` references [init.groovy.d](docker/init.groovy.d).  Scripts in this directory in Jenkins home will be automatically executed during Jenkins startup.  There are 3 scripts in here; two of them install Tools that Jenkins can use (Java and Maven).  The third is more important.  [startup.groovy](docker/init.groovy.d/startup.groovy) creates the [seed](docker/jobs/seed.groovy) job and runs it at startup.  This is great because you can go from a "naked" Jenkins to one with all of your jobs defined and ready to go without any manual intervention.  For more on seed jobs, see [the Jenkins Job DSL Tutorial](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL).
1. The `Dockerfile` references [plugins.txt](docker/plugins.txt).  This text file simply contains a list of Jenkins plugins we wish to be installed as part of the image build.  Note that there are more plugins listed than necessary, but it gives you a flavor of the rich plugin environment that Jenkins supports.
1. The [seed job](docker/jobs/seed.groovy) is set up to create jobs based on the files under the [dsl](docker/dsl) directory.  For your setup there is only one job, [build_pipeline.groovy](docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy) so this whole setup seems like overkill.  However, it is common for a given Jenkins instance to host 10s or 100s of jobs, and managing that many jobs through the Jenkins GUI is cumbersome and difficult.  Study the structure of `build_pipeline.groovy`.  Note that it creates a Pipeline job based on the instructions provided in the [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) from this repo.

#### The Maven Project
The source code for this project is quite simple.  It's a simple Java application and a JUnit test suite.  You won't need to change any of its code.  Note that if you want you can build it from the command line with a simple `mvn clean install`

## Completing the Assignment

### Building a Jenkins job: 

For this lab you will modify the existing Jenkins configuration to have the pipeline job do 3 things:
1. Checkout _your_ repository in build_pipeline.groovy
1. Build the source code using a maven stage
    1. To use maven in a pipeline you need to have access to the `mvn` command, which is provided through a Tool Configuration in Jenkins.  See [the snippet](#maven-pipeline-build-snippet) below for a sample snippet.
    1. Report the unit test results.
        1. See the [Jenkins tutorial](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/tests-and-artifacts/) on how to do this.  Note that the tutorial shows two versions of the pipeline syntax.  By default it shows the Declarative pipeline syntax (which uses `stages` and `post` syntax).  However, we're using the scripted syntax.  There is a link near the bottom labeled "Toggle Scripted Pipeline" to show the scripted syntax.  Use that syntax. There should be no `stages` or `post` keywords.
1. To do so, you will need to:
    1. Change the [build_pipeline.groovy](docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy) to use your repository
    1. Modify your [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) appropriately. 
    1. To test your changes, you can rebuild the docker image running `sudo ./build-jenkins-image.sh` and then start your jenkins instance running `sudo ./run-jenkins.sh`.  Run your `build-pipeline-job` and verify it meets the requirements.

### Before submitting your work:

1. Go to the console output for your most recent successfully built job
2. Right-click on "View as plain text"
3. Choose "Save link as" and save the file as `consoleText.txt` in the root folder of this repo.
4. Make sure to add `consoleText.txt` when you commit your work to your solution branch. 

## Hints
1. We've created a [run-jenkins.sh](run-jenkins.sh) script that will start up jenkins for you if you'd like.  You can view your Jenkins by opening Firefox within your workspace to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
2. If your repository is marked private, you might get an error when running your `build-pipeline` job.  To fix this:
   1. [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key). 
   2. [Add the public (`.pub`) new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
   3. See [Using credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/) in the Jenkins documentation for instructions on how to add your SSH key. 
   4. Select your new credentials in the SCM section of the  [build-pipeline job configuration](http://localhost:8080/job/build-pipeline-job/configure).
3. The [DSL API](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/) is available online.
4. There is a [Pipeline Syntax](http://localhost:8080/job/build-pipeline-job/pipeline-syntax/) page to help you out too!.
5. Note the branch specification in [docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy](docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy).  You will likely not be working on the master branch.
6. To test your changes locally before pushing them to GitHub, you can use the path to your repo as your git URLs in your [docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy](docker/dsl/build_pipeline.groovy) and [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile).  So instead of saying:
```
   def repo = 'https://github.com/jschmersal-cscc/special-topics-labs-ci'
```
you can say:
```
   def repo = '/path/to/your/copy/of/special-topics-labs-ci'
```
Note that you should change this to be your github repo url before finally pushing it to github for testing. 

## Submitting Your Work

1. Publish your repository as a private repo, and ensure that you have pushed the latest version
1. Open a pull request from your branch to master
1. Submit the assignment in Blackboard 

__NOTE: I will provide feedback via. comments in your pull request.__

## Maven Pipeline Build Snippet
Here is a snippet that will be useful to include in your pipeline.  The "build" stage should include something similar to this: 
```
        withMaven (maven: 'maven3') {
          sh "mvn package"
        }
```
The `withMaven` clause does the necessary setup to make the `mvn` executable that corresponds to the `maven3` tool installation
available to the `sh` command.  Without it the `sh` would complain that it couldn't find `mvn`.
